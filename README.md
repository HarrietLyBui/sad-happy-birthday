<b>Inspiration: </b></br></br>
Have you ever only remembered some lyrics of a song but not the song’s name? Have you ever wished to have a companion that may sing with you and be always available when nobody else is? Voice assistant devices such as Amazon Echo have the ability to solve these problems and assist human beings in a more natural way than having us clicking buttons. Therefore, we would like to build a social robot that may sing a song to you even though you are not able to remember the song's name and may even sing a duet with you.</br></br>

<b> Alexa’s Echo sing-off feature: </b> </br></br>
- Has the user sing a song in your natural voice and recognize the song the user sings </br>
- Responds to user’s sing-off request after the user asks Alexa to sing along or sing together. Use following commands to activate the feature: </br>
+ “Alexa, sing along.” if user wants to sing only the first part of the song </br>
+ “Alexa, sing together.” if user wants to sing part of them song while Alexa sings the other parts. See following scripts: </br>

<b>Yesterday:</b></br></br>

User: Yesterday </br>
Alexa: all my troubles seemed so far away </br>
Now it looks as though they're here to stay</br>
User: Oh, I believe in yesterday </br>
Suddenly </br>
Alexa: I'm not half the man I used to be </br>
There's a shadow hanging over me.</br>
Oh, yesterday came suddenly</br>

<b>Over the rainbow </b></br></br>

User: Somewhere over the rainbow </br>
Alexa: 
Way up high </br>
And the dreams that you dream of </br>
Once in a lullaby</br>
User: Somewhere over the rainbow </br>
Bluebirds fly</br>
Alexa: And the dreams that you dream of </br>
Dreams really do come true</br></br>

- Allows you to have Alexa to sing the rest of the song or sing a duet with the user. </br>
- Starts singing the song after the user stops at a certain part of the songs whether it is in the middle of a sentence or the end of a sentence. </br>
- Handles failed request naturally.</br>
